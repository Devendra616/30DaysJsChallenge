# 30 Days of JavaScript Challenge

## Introduction

Welcome to the 30 days of javascript challenge where every day a challenge will get unlocked and you have to finish that challenge and post here at discord. These challenges will grow in complexity every day and will test your JS skills. From JS basics, leetcode to project challenges, all are here. Here is the link to the challenges: https://courses.chaicode.com/learn/30-days-of-Javascript-challenge.

## Day 1 - Variables and Data Types

### Tasks / Activities:

#### Activity 1: Variable Declaration

**Task 1:** ✅ Declare a variable using `var`, assign it a number, and log the value to the console.
**Task 2:** ✅ Declare a variable using `let`, assign it a string, and log the value to the console.

#### Activity 2: Constant Declaration

**Task 3:** ✅ Declare a variable using `const`, assign it a boolean value, and log the value to the console.

#### Activity 3: Data Types

**Task 4:** ✅ Create variables of different data types (number, string, boolean, object, array) and log each variable's type using the `typeof` operator.

#### Activity 4: Reassigning Variables

**Task 5:** ✅ Declare a variable using let, assign it an initial value, reassign a new value, and log both values to the console.

#### Activity 5: Understanding `const`

**Task 6:** ✅ Try reassigning a variable declared with `const` and observe the error.

### Feature Request :

1.  **Variable Types Console Log:** Write a script that declares variables of different data types and logs both the value and type of each variable to the console.
2.  **Reassignment Demo:** Create a script that demonstrates the difference in behavior between let and const when it comes to reassignment.

### Achievement:

By the end of these activities, you will:

- Know how to declare variables using `var`, `let`, and `const`.
- Understand the different data types in JavaScript.
- Be able to use the `typeof` operator to identify the data type of a variable.
- Understand the concept of variable reassignment and the immutability of `const` variables.

### Solution:

## Day 2 - Operators

### Tasks / Activities:

#### Activity 1: Arithmetic Operators

**Task 1:** ✅ Write a program to add two numbers and log the result to the console.

**Task 2:** ✅ Write a program to subtract two numbers and log the result to the console.

**Task 3:** ✅ Write a program to multiply two numbers and log the result to the console.

**Task 4:** ✅ Write a program to divide two numbers and log the result to the console.

**Task 5:** ✅ Write a program to calculate the remainder of two numbers and log the result to the console.

#### Activity 2: Assignment Operators

**Task 6:** ✅ Use the `+=` operator to add a number to a variable and log the result to the console.

**Task 7:** ✅ Use the `-=` operator to subtract a number from a variable and log the result to the console.

#### Activity 3: Comparison Operators

**Task 8:** ✅ Write a program to compare two numbers using `>` and `<` and log the result to the console.

**Task 9:** ✅ Write a program to compare two numbers using `>=` and `<=` and log the result to the console.

**Task 10:** ✅ Write a program to compare two numbers using `==` and `===` and log the result to the console.

#### Activity 4: Logical Operators

**Task 11:** ✅ Write a program that uses the `&&` operator to combine two conditions and log the result to the console.

**Task 12:** ✅ Write a program that uses the `||` operator to combine two conditions and log the result to the console.

**Task 13:** ✅ Write a program that uses the `!` operator to negate a condition and log the result to the console.

#### Activity 5: Ternary Operator

**Task 14:** ✅ Write a program that uses the ternary operator to check if a number is positive or negative and log the result to the console.

### Achievement:

By the end of these activities, you will:

- Understand and use arithmetic operators to perform basic calculations.
- Use assignment operators to modify variable values.
- Compare values using comparison operators.
- Combine conditions using logical operators.
- Use the ternary operator for concise conditional expressions.

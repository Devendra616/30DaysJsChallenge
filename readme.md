function sayHello1() {
  console.log("Hello1!");

## Day 15 - Closures

### Common Use Cases:

#### Data Privacy:

Closures allow you to create private variables. Only functions within the closure can access them.
Useful for implementing modules or libraries.

Closures are often used for callbacks. Think event listeners or asynchronous operations.
The callback function retains access to its surrounding context.

#### Memoization:

Closures can cache expensive computations.
Example: Fibonacci sequence calculation.

#### Gotchas:

_Memory Leaks:_
Be careful! Closures can keep references to objects, preventing them from being garbage collected.
_Binding Issues:_
Be aware of how this behaves inside closures. It can catch you off guard.

### Tasks / Activities:

**Task 3:** ✅ Write a function that generates unique IDs. Use a closure to keep track of the last generated ID and increment it with each call.

**Task 4:** ✅ Create a closure that captures a user's name and returns a function that greets the user by name.

#### Activity 3: Closures in Loop

**Task 5:** ✅ Write a loop that creates an array of functions. Each function should log its index when called. Use a closure to ensure each function logs the correct index.

#### Activity 4: Module Pattern

**Task 6:** ✅ Use closures to create a simple module for managing a collection of items. Implement methods to add, remove, and list items.

#### Activity 5: Memoization

**Task 7:** ✅ Write a function that memoizes the results of another function. Use a closure to store the results of previous computations.

## Day 19 - Regular Expressions

### Tasks / Activities:

#### Activity 1: Regular Expressions

**Task 1:** ✅ Write a regular expression to match a simple pattern (e.g., match all occurrences of the word "JavaScript" in a string). Log the matches.

**Task 2:** ✅ Write a regular expression to match all digits in a string. Log the matches.

#### Activity 2: Character Classes and Quantifiers

**Task 3:** ✅ Write a regular expression to match all words in a string that start with a capital letter. Log the matches.

**Task 4:** ✅ Write a regular expression to match all sequences of one or more digits in a string. Log the matches.

#### Activity 3: Grouping and Capturing

##### Grouping

Grouping in regular expressions is done using parentheses `()`. It allows you to:

1. **Apply Quantifiers**: You can apply quantifiers (like `*`, `+`, `{n}`) to the entire group.
2. **Create Subpatterns**: Grouping helps in creating subpatterns within the main pattern.

For example, in the regex `(abc)+`, the group `(abc)` can be repeated one or more times due to the `+` quantifier.

##### Capturing

Capturing is a feature of grouping that allows you to extract parts of the matched string. Each group in parentheses is assigned a number based on its position in the pattern, starting from 1.

For example, in the regex `(\d{3})-(\d{2})-(\d{4})`:

- `(\d{3})` captures the first three digits.
- `(\d{2})` captures the next two digits.
- `(\d{4})` captures the last four digits.

##### Non-Capturing Groups

If you want to group parts of the pattern without capturing, you can use (?:...). For example, (?:abc)+ will match one or more occurrences of abc but won’t capture them.

**Task 5:** ✅ Write a regular expression to capture the area code, central office code, and line number from a US phone number format (e.g., (123) 456-7890). Log the captures.

**Task 6:** ✅ Write a regular expression to capture the username and domain from an email address. Log the captures.

#### Activity 4: Assertions and Boundaries

#### Assertions

Assertions are conditions that must be true for a match to occur, but they do not consume characters in the input string. There are two main types of assertions: lookaheads and lookbehinds.

##### Lookaheads

Lookaheads assert that a certain pattern must follow the current position in the string.

- **Positive Lookahead**: `(?=...)`

  - Example: `\d(?=px)` matches a digit only if it is followed by "px".
  - `"5px"` matches `5`, but `"5pt"` does not match.

- **Negative Lookahead**: `(?!...)`
  - Example: `\d(?!px)` matches a digit only if it is not followed by "px".
  - `"5pt"` matches `5`, but `"5px"` does not match.

##### Lookbehinds

Lookbehinds assert that a certain pattern must precede the current position in the string.

- **Positive Lookbehind**: `(?<=...)`

  - Example: `(?<=\$)\d+` matches digits only if they are preceded by a dollar sign.
  - `"$100"` matches `100`, but `"100"` does not match.

- **Negative Lookbehind**: `(?<!...)`
  - Example: `(?<!\$)\d+` matches digits only if they are not preceded by a dollar sign.
  - `"100"` matches `100`, but `"$100"` does not match.

#### Boundaries

Boundaries are used to match positions in the input string rather than actual characters. They help in defining the start or end of words or lines.

##### Word Boundaries

- **Word Boundary**: `\b`

  - Matches the position between a word character (like a letter or digit) and a non-word character (like a space or punctuation).
  - Example: `\bword\b` matches "word" as a whole word.
  - `"word"` matches, but `"sword"` and `"words"` do not match.

- **Non-Word Boundary**: `\B`
  - Matches the position where `\b` does not match.
  - Example: `\Bword\B` matches "word" only if it is part of a larger word.
  - `"sword"` and `"words"` match, but `"word"` does not match.

##### Line Boundaries

- **Start of Line**: `^`

  - Matches the position at the start of a line.
  - Example: `^Hello` matches "Hello" only if it is at the beginning of a line.

- **End of Line**: `$`
  - Matches the position at the end of a line.
  - Example: `world$` matches "world" only if it is at the end of a line.

**Task 7:** ✅ Write a regular expression to match a word only if it is at the beginning of a string. Log the matches.

**Task 8:** ✅ Write a regular expression to match a word only if it is at the end of a string. Log the matches.

#### Activity 5: Practical Applications

**Task 9:** ✅ Write a regular expression to validate a simple password (must include at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one digit, and one special character). Log whether the password is valid.

**Task 10:** ✅ Write a regular expression to validate a URL. Log whether the URL is valid.

## Day 20: Local Storage and Session Storage

### LocalStorage

**LocalStorage** is a type of web storage that allows you to store data in the browser with no expiration date. This means the data will persist even after the browser is closed and reopened. It’s useful for storing data that you want to keep available across sessions.

### Key Features

- **Persistence**: Data remains until explicitly deleted.
- **Scope**: Shared across all tabs and windows with the same origin.
- **Capacity**: Typically around 5MB, but this can vary by browser.

### Common Methods

- `setItem(key, value)`: Stores a key-value pair.
- `getItem(key)`: Retrieves the value associated with the key.
- `removeItem(key)`: Removes the key-value pair.
- `clear()`: Clears all stored data.
- `key(index)`: Returns the key at the specified index.
- `length`: Returns the number of stored items.

### SessionStorage

**SessionStorage** allows you to store data that is only available for the duration of the page session. The data is cleared when the page session ends, such as when the browser tab or window is closed.

### Key Features

- **Persistence**: Data is cleared when the page session ends.
- **Scope**: Specific to the tab or window where it was created.
- **Capacity**: Typically around 5MB, but this can vary by browser.

### Common Methods

- `setItem(key, value)`: Stores a key-value pair.
- `getItem(key)`: Retrieves the value associated with the key.
- `removeItem(key)`: Removes the key-value pair.
- `clear()`: Clears all stored data.
- `key(index)`: Returns the key at the specified index.
- `length`: Returns the number of stored items.

## Day 5 - Functions

To **declare** a function, you use the `function` keyword and specify a name for the function.

In **function expressions**, you create a function expression and assign it to a `variable` that can be called.

Function expression can also be created using the `arrow function` syntax.

**Note:** Expressed functions cannot be used before initialization. But can use delcared function before its initialization. Declared functions are `hoisted` to the top of the scope.

```javascript
sayHello1(); // Hello1!
sayHello2(); // ReferenceError:Cannot access 'sayHello2' before initialization
sayHello3(); //ReferenceError: Cannot access 'sayHello3' before initialization

// function declaration
function sayHello1() {
  console.log("Hello1!");
}

// anonymous function expression
const sayHello2 = function () {
  console.log("Hello2!");
};

// arrow function expression
const sayHello3 = () => {
  console.log("Hello3!");
};
```
